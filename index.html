                <p>How do you determine what is valuable? What should you keep? How do you go about caring for what you value? If you are an artist, work at a cultural institution, or direct a nonprofit organization it may feel particularly challenging to start thinking about and taking action to care for valuable information assets.</p>

                <p>Regardless of size or resources, every organization should have the opportunity to be proactive and intentional in ensuring future access to the information they value. But planning for the future is different from focusing on the needs of the current moment.</p>

                <p>Our approach centers on guiding and empowering the people and organizations we work with to integrate the practice of caring for information assets into the creation process itself. We collaborate with clients to develop a custom strategy that makes sense for their context, provide guidance to help them put that strategy into action, and offer continued support in maintaining and evolving this strategy over time.</p>

This is a highly collaborative process where we define what digital materials are valuable and why they should be cared for; the changes and investments needed to ensure future access; and a timeline for making changes. The resulting strategy provides a foundation for growth and a customized and detailed roadmap and set of recommendations for integrating future access into your current production process.</p>

These shifts can take time, and I’ll be there as long as you need me.</p>

                    <p>Sam an archivist and educator based in Columbus, Ohio who has been working in and with libraries, archives, museums, galleries, artists, and nonprofit organizations for over 15 years. He is drawn to this work because he sees the potential for people to create their own archives for their creative practices, their organizations, and their communities. With Future Access For All he is seeking to expand archival thinking and practice to new contexts, to guide and support people in taking action to ensure the digital materials they are creating continue to exist for as long as they need them. Previously, Sam served as the Preservation Communities Manager at the Educopia Institute, and before that as the Digital Archivist at the University of Montana. He received my M.L.I.S from San Jose State University, and B.A. in Visual Arts from the University of California, San Diego.</p>
